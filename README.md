## Hi there everybody!

 ### My name is Aiden, I'm a biology undergraduate student with a data analysis day job (I work with a lot of data that lives in Excel files, but I really want to upgrade my data handling/analysis skills). 

### My interests are in data science, particularly bioinformatics but especially computational biology. Computers were invented to help scientists do their jobs better, and I want to follow in the eminent tradition of people using computers to further our understanding of life on our planet. 

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
R and Python (particularly for its applications in genetics/genomics research).

#### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with
how to better apply computer programming and data science skills to biology research.
